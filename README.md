# laravel-realtime-restapi

A simple rest api with CRUD functionalities built using the laravel 8 framework with sanctum for authentication. The project was built following the tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MT-GJQIY3EU.

Realtime messaging added to Laravel server and Android app client using Laravel Echo following: https://medium.com/swlh/receiving-laravel-echo-socket-io-messages-in-android-application-a2e1a3d83c5d (tutorial does not mention all necessary steps clearly, had to fix some things to make it work).
